    "\n",
    "Thus, for \\( n \\) vehicles and \\( t \\) routes, the QUBO has \\( N = n \\cdot t \\) variables, indexed \\( q \\in [0, N-1] \\).  \n",

    "Instead of picking a fixed λ (e.g., λ = 10), we **analyze the actual congestion values** in the QUBO and adapt λ accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each vehicle and valid route \\( q \\), we check how \"important\" that variable is in the objective function by calculating its **total contribution to congestion** (how strongly it interacts with others):\n",

    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives you a λ that is **greater than any one variable’s contribution to congestion**, ensuring that violating the constraint (e.g., choosing two routes) is always worse than any potential gain in the objective.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatically **adjusts for the scale** of congestion weights.\n",
    "- Ensures that **even the worst-case constraint violation** (selecting two routes) incurs a penalty greater than any benefit from objective reduction.\n"
